1\. Image Build Automation 

1. **Objective**: Automate the image-building process using GitHub Actions API. 
1. **Steps**: 
   1. Choose an application with multiple services. 
   1. Set up GitHub Actions workflows for building Docker images. 
   1. Configure workflows to trigger changes to the repository. 
   1. Test the automation process to ensure successful image builds. 
2. Infrastructure as Code (IAC) Deployment 
   1. **Objective**: Deploy a Kubernetes cluster using Infrastructure as Code methodology. 
   1. **Steps**: 
      1. Prerequisite: Ensure you have Terraform installed on your local machine. 
      1. Tool Choice: Terraform as the IAC tool for Kubernetes cluster deployment. 
      1. Infrastructure Code: Write Terraform infrastructure code ( main.tf ,  variables.tf , etc.) to define the desired state of the Kubernetes cluster. 
      1. Provisioning: Apply the Terraform infrastructure code to provision the Kubernetes cluster. **Note**: While the cluster can be hosted on any cloud provider, this guide assumes deployment on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). 
      1. Deployment Management: Install ArgoCD on the Kubernetes cluster for continuous deployment and management. 
      1. Security Enhancement: Implement encryption for environment files or key-value pairs using Kubernetes secrets. 
3. Monitoring and Observability Deployment 
- **Objective**: Deploy applications for monitoring metrics and logs. 
- **Steps**: 
  - Choose one or more monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack). 
  - Deploy the selected monitoring tools to collect and visualize metrics and logs. 
  - Configure alerting rules to notify of any critical issues or anomalies. 
4. Cluster Autoscaling 
- **Objective**: Integrate a cluster autoscaler to dynamically adjust cluster resources. 
- **Steps**: 
  - Choose a cluster autoscaler compatible with the chosen Kubernetes distribution. 
  - Install and configure the cluster autoscaler to automatically adjust the cluster size based on resource utilization metrics. 
5. Ingress Configuration 
- **Objective**: Enable ingress for all applications running on the cluster. 
- **Steps**: 
  - Choose an ingress controller (e.g., NGINX Ingress Controller). 
  - Configure the ingress controller to route external traffic to services within the cluster. 
  - Test ingress configuration to ensure external access to applications. 

**Conclusion** 

This documentation provides a detailed overview of the tasks involved in the Capstone Project. Follow the outlined steps to successfully complete each task and demonstrate proficiency in deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters using modern DevOps practices and tools.
